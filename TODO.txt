edge cases to test:
user attempts to scrape but isnt on etsy
user attempts to scrape on other systems
user installs to chromium/older versions of chrome
scraping from within intranet 
check library issues for more possible test cases

capture what each email bought
user settings dropdown with different options
add promises or callback chaining for page requests
add a little question mark with information about the app
make the extension remain on top instead of closing on focus loss

possible premium features:
higher max page count
